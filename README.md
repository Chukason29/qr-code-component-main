### What I learned

- I learned how to add box shadows to elements especially text elements


```html
<article class="border-radius">
      <div class="border-radius">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" class="border-radius">
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <p>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </article>
```
```css
.details p:first-child{
    color:hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-size: 1.3rem;
    font-weight:700;
    text-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 2px hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  }
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources
